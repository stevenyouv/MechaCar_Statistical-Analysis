# MechaCar_Statistical-Analysis

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to use statistics and hypothesis testing to review the production data in the automotive industry to give insights that can help AutosRUs with the manufacturing team with its production troubles with their newest protoype, the MechaCar.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

1. Based on the Pr, the vehicle length and vehicle ground clerance are statistically likely to provide non-random amounts of variance to the model.  

2. The p-Value for this model, p-Value: 5.35e-11, is much smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05%. This indicates there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which further indcates that the slope of this linear model is not zero.

3. This linear model has an r-squared value of 0.7149, which means that approximately 71% of all mpg predictions will be determined by this model. Relatively speaking, this multiple regression model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.

- When looking at the entire population of the production lot, the variance of the coils is 62.29 PSI, which is well within the 100 PSI variant requirement.  

- Lots 1 and 2 are significantly more consistent and well within the 100 PSI variance requirement with variances of .98 and 7.47 respectively 
- 
- Lot 3 shows a much larger variance in performance and consistency with a variance of 170.29 PSI which is well outside the requirement of 100 PSI
